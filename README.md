# SwitchBounce
Arduino sketch that inputs the state of a switch and sequentially lights each LED as the switch is depressed. The program detects high to low transitions at the input and lights the next LED in the sequence. In the presence of switch bounce, a switch being depressed will advance the sequence by more than one LED. This demonstrates mechanical switch bounce.
